## Turkey Tracker

This is one of the main projects that I have been working on Winter Semester at BYU-I for CIT_261

It is a web application that can be used to:
* Find your location
* Mark turkey sightings in an area with markers
* Add different types of markers and be able to edit the markers
* See the forecast for the next 5 days (including wind directions

This is written in HTML5, CSS, and Javascript.

So far I have learned how to better implement the code in Javascript and HTML. There is a steep learning curve in making a web application look good. There was a lot of trouble adding the bars for the markers and the weather. I first tried to solve this problem using a grid layout but it was causing problems with the google maps section. I also had to work around Javascript's design. I have coded in C++ for a while and i use pass by reference constantly. Since Javascript does not implement it, I had to figure out workarounds. Also, I have implements some cool Javascript features that I
did not know about like the split("") function. This splits a string into an array based on what you put within the quotes. 
Very useful.

#### APIs
* Google Maps API
* Google geolocation API
* Open weather API
* Accuweather API

#### Current Status
* Google maps API is up and running in the correct color
* Everything in zoned out where it is meant to be
* The script is receiving open weather information but UX and UI need improvements
* Added markers on click on the google maps section of the page
* Need to add different markers and use touch and hold events to place marker

## Carbon

Carbon is the second main project that I have been working on in the Winter Semester at BYU-I for CIT_261

This web application is meant to
* Display everything is a simple and effective manner
* Added button effects when clicked
* Help someone learn or understand machine learning vocab
* Be able to do simple calculations

This is written in HTML5, CSS, and Javascript.

This project ran in parallel to the Quakes activity that we did in class. The main reason for this is to better understand how
to split up the code in an effective manner and to have everything working together fluidly. Some of the first problems that hit
were fully understanding what each of the JS files does and how to make the controller and the view JS files work together. This
was a lot of trial and error at first and then taking a step back to review the Quakes code to more fully understand why it was
created how it was. The second stumbling block was generating each of the pages to display in a clean manner. This again was a
lot of trial and error with more success then that first problem. I relied heavily on google and different forms for specific
CSS problems that came up. 

#### Current Status
* Buttons are generating from a JSON file
* Separated JS files into controller and view like Quake example
* Each page is created equally and looks great
* Need to add some content to each of the subpages
* Need to implement the Calculator button
