## Turkey Tracker

This is the main project that i have been working on Winter Semester at BYU-I for CIT_261

It is a web application that can be used to:
* Find your location
* Mark turkey sightings in an area with markers
* Add different types of markers and be able to edit the markers
* See the forcast for the next 5 days (including wind directions

This is writen in HTML5, CSS, and Javascript.

So far I have learned how to better implement code in Javascipt and HTML. There is a steep learning curve in making 
a web application look good. There was a lot of trouble adding the bars for the markers and the weather. I first tried 
to solve this problem using a grid layout but it was causing problems with the google maps section. I also had to work 
around Javascript's design. I have coded in C++ for a while adn i use pass by reference constantly. Since Javascirpt 
does not implement it, I had to figue out work arounds. Also i have implements some cool Javascripts features that I
did not know about like the split("") function. This splits a string into an array based on what you put within the quotes. 
Very useful.

### APIs
* Google Maps API
* Google geolocation API
* Open weather API
* Accuweather API

### Current Status
* Google maps API is up and running in the correct color
* Everything in zoned out where it is ment to be
* The script is reciving open weather information but UX and UI need improvments
* Added markers on click on the google maps section of the page
* Need to add different markers and use a touch and hold event to place marker
